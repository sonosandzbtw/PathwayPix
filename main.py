Biochemistry is usually taught as a list of things to memorize: pathways, enzymes, cofactors, and control steps. But for me, it was never about memorization.

I‚Äôve always been in love with organic chemistry. And one day it just clicked‚Äîbiochemistry is organic chemistry in motion. It's not random, it's not arbitrary. Carbon atoms are reacting, adapting, and creating logic with every step. That‚Äôs when I stopped seeing it as content to study and started seeing it as a system to understand.

Textbooks don‚Äôt help with that. They show you what happens, but not why it happens. They flatten the story into static diagrams and bullet points. So I made this.

PathwayPix is for anyone who wants to see biochemistry as a logical, visual, moving system. Where structure changes make sense. Where enzymes don‚Äôt just do things‚Äîthey have reasons.

---

### Why I Made This

I want people to see what's really going on.

Instead of flipping flashcards, you‚Äôll be tracing reaction paths. You'll see how glucose gets trapped inside a cell, how a phosphate group sets up a molecular ambush, how ATP investment pays off downstream.

And most importantly, you‚Äôll learn the why behind every shift. Why isomerization happens before cleavage. Why regulation hits that step and not the next one. Why the same carbon framework flows one way in a fed state and the opposite way in a fasted state.

---

### Design Philosophy

Every isomerization has a reason. It‚Äôs not a coincidence. It‚Äôs chemistry working for strategy‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs about making a bond breakable, setting up redox, or preparing symmetry.

Regulation tells a story. It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúthis step is inhibited.‚Äù It‚Äôs about commitment points, metabolic pressure, and the system adapting to context. The story of glycolysis changes depending on insulin, glucagon, or ATP levels. That‚Äôs what makes it fascinating.

---

### What You‚Äôll Get Out of This

You‚Äôll stop memorizing.
You‚Äôll start understanding.

You‚Äôll begin to see pathways not as walls of facts, but as beautifully engineered systems‚Äîwhere carbon, electrons, and enzymes are just doing what they do best.

Let carbon do its thing. You‚Äôll see.
